          SensAI is a Lahore-based team of physicians, computer scientists, and entrepreneurs united by one belief: no one should die of a treatable illness simply because expert advice is out of reach. In Pakistan, half of the population will never meet a doctor, and for those who do, care is largely fragmented, event-triggered, and often delivered by under-trained providers– contributing to half a million medication-related deaths each year and a 15 % drag on national GDP. <br /> <br />
            
          To close this gap, we are building a Synthetic Medical Intelligence (SMI) named SensAI. Trained on locally sourced, physician-augmented encounters– beginning with Urdu and Punjabi consultations in a busy Lahore clinic– SensAI already records, transcribes, and drafts GP-quality notes with more than 95 % accuracy. Our roadmap links these notes to problem lists, evidence-based care plans, labs, pharmacies, imaging centers, and patients' smartphones, creating a fully closed loop of primary care. <br /><br />
        
          Our vision is bold yet practical: a platform that lets anyone with a high-school education deliver primary-care advice on par with a seasoned GP after just three days of training. By scaling to 150 000 curated encounters in six months, SensAI will evolve into a self-improving assistant capable of triaging common conditions in real time and escalating complex cases to physicians–an approach that could reclaim one-third of the economic loss caused by inadequate primary care in Pakistan and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). <br /><br />
        
          Backed by deep ties to Lahore's medical-school network, LUMS, and collaborators in the US and China, we have already deployed SensAI in live clinical settings and demonstrated its impact. With an additional US $2.5 million in growth capital, we will expand our team, process the remaining dataset, and bring SensAI's next-generation capabilities to millions–transforming community health in Pakistan and, ultimately, across the globe. <br />
