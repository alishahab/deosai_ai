          Deosai Medtech is a U.S.-based team of physicians, computer scientists, and entrepreneurs united by one belief: no one should suffer a treatable illness simply because expert medical advice is out of reach. <br /> <br />

          Our flagship platform, SensAI, is a Synthetic Medical Intelligence (SMI) built to extend the reach and consistency of primary care—especially in areas underserved by physicians or modern clinical tools. By listening to doctor-patient conversations, SensAI automatically records, transcribes, and generates clinical notes with over 98% accuracy, helping clinicians save time, standardize care, and focus on what matters most: their patients. <br /><br />

          But that’s only the beginning. Trained and validated on physician-augmented encounters across diverse clinical settings, SensAI generates complete problem lists, lab and imaging orders, prescriptions, and specialist referrals—creating a closed loop of intelligent primary care delivery. <br /><br />

          What truly sets SensAI apart is its ability to provide real-time clinical prompts during consultations, suggesting relevant questions, differential diagnoses, and guideline-based care steps to enhance decision-making and improve care quality. <br /><br />

          SensAI is uniquely positioned to strengthen telemedicine and hybrid care, bridging the gap between patients and clinicians with scalable, evidence-based intelligence. Our vision is bold yet practical: to make high-quality medical guidance universally accessible. <br /><br />

          Headquartered in the United States, with clinical pilots successfully conducted in high-volume hospitals involving more than 200 physicians, Deosai Medtech is now expanding SensAI’s capabilities and partnerships across North America, the Middle East, and Europe. We are scaling our data, refining our models, and bringing SensAI’s next-generation intelligence to millions—transforming how primary care is delivered, documented, and accessed worldwide. <br />
